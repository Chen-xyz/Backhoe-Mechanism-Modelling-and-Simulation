Introduction
=================

The main goal of this project is to create a model for the mechanical linkage system of the
backhoe of a Caterpillar backhoe loader. The Backhoe mechanism contains many components
such as pumps, and motors. However, in this project, only rigid bars and hydraulic bars are
considered. In order to create a model of such a system, the following tasks must be done:
1. Analyze the triangle formed by the backhoe, the angles of the triangle formed by
the bars of the backhoe were found in order to determine the rotation of the bar
2. The coordinate of the triangle at each frame needed to be found in order to locate the
location of the bar.
